                <p>Dr Francesco Restuccia is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Engineering at King's College London in the UK from November 2019. 
                 He Comes from Italy, and obtained his MEng Degree in Electrical and Mechanical Engineering from the University of Edinburgh. He was then awarded
                 a departmental scholarship to attend the California Institute of Technology, USA, where he obtained an MS in Mechanical Engineering, focusing on 
		 thermofluids topics. He was awarded a prestigious EPSRC International DTP PhD fellowship to pursue his PhD at Imperial College London, where he 
		 obtained a PhD with research focusing on self-heating ignition. Francesco then carried out work as a Research Associate at the same institution, 
		 initially as part of an ERC project led by Prof Rein, and then funded by a Departmental Fellowship. During his Research Asssociate position 
		 Francesco focused on applied heat transfer, for problems ranging from heat recovery to ignition of batteries and finally spread of smouldering fires.
                 Francesco's multidisciplinary work was recognized by three different disciplines when he won the 2016 Sugden Award from the Combustion Institute 
		 for the most significant UK contribution to combustion research, the 2016 Best PhD Student Seminar in Thermofluids (Department of Mechanical Engineering) 
		 and the 2015 Early Career Scientist Travel Award from the European Geoscience Union for his work on self-heating ignition. He received the honourable mention 
		 (runner up) for the worldwide best thesis award of the International Association for Fire Safety Science. He is also recognized for his
	         peer-review work (>140 papers reviewed), and has won the 2020 Jack Watts award for Outstanding reviewer from Fire Technology. Francesco is 
		 extremely passionate about engineering education and in 2021 was Shortlisted for the King’s College London King’s Education Rising Star Award, 
		 as the sole candidate chosen out of his Faculty. Furthermore, he was the 2019 winner of the  Imperial College Union Student Academic Choice Awards 
		 for Student Wellbeing Champion, for his work in supporting undergaduate students.   </p>
